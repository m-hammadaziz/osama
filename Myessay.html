There are various forms of Pollution, like <i>land pollution</i>,<i>water pollution</i>,<i>air pollution</i>, and <i>soil pollution</i>. No matter which form of infection it is, it has dangerous impacts on our environment.
    <h5><b>TYPES OF POLLUTION</b></h5>
<p>Pollution is the addition of unwanted substances into the environment that can damage our Earth. There are 4 main types of Pollution; water pollution, air pollution, soil pollution, and noise pollution. All kinds of Pollution are a result of careless activities by man. We dump waste directly into water bodies, which results in water pollution. Air pollution is caused when vehicles release smoke into the atmosphere and make it difficult to breathe for all organisms. Soil pollution is caused by directly dumping our waste into landfills. Noise pollution is not visible, but it is a dangerous form of Pollution that can damage our ears.
<h5>CAUSE AND EFFECTS</h5><p>Release of sulphur dioxide and hazardous gases into the air causes global warming and acid rain which have increased temperatures, erratic rains and droughts, making it tough for the animals to survive. We breathe in every polluted particle from the air. The result is the increase in asthma and cancer in the lungs.
    <br><img src="pollution 2.jpg" width="360" height="250"><h5>PREVENTION</h5><p>Modifying a production process to produce less waste. Using non-toxic or less toxic chemicals as cleaners, degreasers and other maintenance chemicals. Implementing water and energy conservation practices. Reusing materials such as drums and pallets rather than disposing of them as waste.
